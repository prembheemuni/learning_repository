# ‚úÖ Phase 5: Fine-Tuning, Open-Source LLMs & Multi-Modal AI (Months 13‚Äì15)

## Month 13: Fine-Tuning & Custom Models

### Intro to Fine-Tuning
- [ ] Fine-tuning means training an existing model like GPT or LLaMA on your own data.
- [ ] It helps the model specialize in your domain (e.g., legal, finance, code).

### When to Fine-Tune vs Prompt
- [ ] If you just want formatting or logic changes ‚Üí use prompt engineering.
- [ ] Fine-tune only when you need deeper domain understanding or faster inference.

### Dataset Preparation
- [ ] Create JSONL files with `{prompt: "...", completion: "..."}` structure.
- [ ] Clean and format your examples with consistent syntax and labels.

### Fine-Tuning OpenAI Models
- [ ] Use `openai.FineTuningJob.create()` with classification, summarization, or formatting tasks.
- [ ] Example: Fine-tune on product descriptions ‚Üí GPT outputs perfect SEO copy.

### Eval & Deployment
- [ ] Evaluate model with BLEU, ROUGE, or manually for precision and consistency.
- [ ] Use the fine-tuned model with a special model ID: `ft:gpt-3.5-custom-abc123`.

## Month 14: Open-Source LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, Ollama)

### Model Zoo Exploration
- [ ] Try models like LLaMA 2, Mistral 7B, Mixtral, TinyLLaMA for local experimentation.
- [ ] Each has trade-offs in size, latency, and quality (vs GPT-4).

### Running with Ollama
- [ ] Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to run models locally with 1-line installs.
- [ ] Example: `ollama run mistral` spins up a fast 7B model on your machine.

### Transformers & HuggingFace
- [ ] Use `transformers` to load models and `datasets` to train or fine-tune them.
- [ ] Example: Load `llama-2-7b` with `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()`.

### Quantization & Acceleration
- [ ] Use 4-bit or 8-bit quantized models to run big models on limited GPUs or CPUs.
- [ ] Tools like `bitsandbytes` or `gguf` make inference much faster and lighter.

### Private Hosting with FastAPI
- [ ] Serve an open-source model as a FastAPI endpoint locally or via Docker.
- [ ] Example: `/chat-oss` calls your own LLaMA model ‚Üí useful for low-latency apps.

## Month 15: Multi-Modal AI (Image + Text + Code)

### Vision + Text with GPT-4V
- [ ] Use GPT-4 Vision to analyze images (e.g. charts, receipts, UIs).
- [ ] Example: Upload a screenshot of UI ‚Üí GPT suggests accessibility improvements.

### CLIP & BLIP for Local Vision Models
- [ ] Use CLIP to match text and images, or BLIP to generate captions for images.
- [ ] Example: Use BLIP to caption uploaded images, and then run Q&A with GPT.

### Whisper for Audio Transcription
- [ ] Use OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper for converting audio ‚Üí text (even noisy speech).
- [ ] Example: Upload a customer call ‚Üí transcribe ‚Üí extract sentiment or generate summary.

### Code + Text Models (Codex, DeepSeek, CodeLLaMA)
- [ ] Use Codex or CodeLLaMA to power code generation, debugging, or test writing tools.
- [ ] Example: Describe a function ‚Üí Model generates TypeScript + test cases.

### Building a Multi-modal Agent
- [ ] Let user upload image + ask question ‚Üí App uses GPT-4V or image encoder + GPT.
- [ ] Example: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the error in this screenshot?‚Äù ‚Üí GPT explains and suggests fix.

## Projects for Practice

### Project 1: Domain-Fine-Tuned Support Bot
- [ ] Fine-tune GPT-3.5 on your company FAQs, SOPs, and emails.
- [ ] Example: ‚ÄúHow to cancel a premium subscription?‚Äù ‚Üí Model responds in your tone.

### Project 2: Local LLaMA Q&A Service
- [ ] Serve LLaMA/Mistral with Ollama + FastAPI for private document Q&A.
- [ ] Example: Private wiki ‚Üí Embed ‚Üí Query locally ‚Üí Chatbot responds instantly.

### Project 3: Image Q&A Web App
- [ ] Upload image ‚Üí GPT-4V analyzes ‚Üí Chatbot answers queries visually.
- [ ] Example: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the warning in this screenshot?‚Äù ‚Üí GPT describes it.

### Project 4: Audio Transcript Summarizer
- [ ] Upload a meeting recording ‚Üí Whisper transcribes ‚Üí GPT summarizes + action items.
- [ ] Example: ‚ÄúMarketing call from April 10th‚Äù ‚Üí Summary + next steps sent via email.
